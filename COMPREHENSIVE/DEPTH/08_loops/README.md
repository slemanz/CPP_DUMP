# Loops

**Enter the while loop..**

We can use something called a "while loop". It is a programming construct that
keeps repeating whatever you put inside of it until a certain condition is
false. Yes you heard that right, I said "condition". We can use the conditions
exactly like those we have been using in our conditional statements (if, else
if, else).

**Keep calm and CTRL-C**

When your programs are careening out of control without any sign of stopping,
you can always click in your console area and do a CTRL-C key combination (hold
CTRL and press C). This will kill the current process that is running (which is
most likely your unstoppable loop program at this point).

**Isn't one loop enough?**

If you had a lot of these loops in your program it could be easy to make a
mistake and get trapped in an infinite loop somewhere. You would then have to
track it down and fix it. But there is a better solution...

**Enter the "for" loop**

This is a loop that is useful for running for a specific number of iterations.
We can define the counter variable on the same line as the loop declaration.
