# Logic

You most likely have heard of Logic.

Someone most likely referred to using logic as common sense.

For example: "If all dogs have a keen sense of smell, and my pet is a dog, then
my pet has a keen sense of smell"

This probably seems like something that doesn't need an explanation...

"If bob doesn't not have a watermelon, he will not get all bananas if both
oranges and red or yellow apples are available"

This is slightly harder to immediately decipher what is going on in the
statement.

Replace the fruit with data, and this might be something that you could
potentially have to represent in your code. Thankfully, there are ways we can
represent statements like this in simpler terms, and concrete rules we can
follow solve logic problems.

Similar to deciphering word problems in math, we can look for the important bits
in this sentence that have logical significance.

"**If** bob **doesn't not** have a watermelon, he will **not** get all bananas
**if** both oranges **and** red **or** yellow apples are available"

### Boolean Values

Boolean values are either TRUE or FALSE

When we rearrange normal statements into a collection of true and false
statements, we can create code that can filter output based on conditions.

TRUE and FALSE are synonymous with 1 and 0 in computer science
