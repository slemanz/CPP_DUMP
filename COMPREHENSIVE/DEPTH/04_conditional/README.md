# Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in C++ allow programs to make decisions and execute
different blocks of code based on whether specific conditions are true or false.
These statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program. 

> One thing to know the only value to be false is *zero*, other values are true
> even negatives ones.
