## Bubble sort

Is a simple sorting algorithm used in computer science to arrange elements of a
list (such as an array) in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.

It is one of the easiest sorting algorithms to understand and implement.

Its average and worst-case time complexity is O(nÂ²), making it inefficient for
large datasets.

The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, comparing adjacent elements.

## Insetion Sort

**The opposite of bubbling**

The goal of isertion sort is to pull a new element into the leftmost sorted
portion of an array/vector and keep doing so until the array vector is reached.
