# Comprehensive

This repository can be useful for someone who has zero programming experience, or
for experienced developers who want to refresh on Data Structures and Algorithms
concepts for interviews.

We don't only want you to understand how to write code. We also want you to
understand what goes on behind the scenes. Because of this, in addition to
programming/DS/Algo we will cover:

- Compilation
- Multiple debugger options
- Binary and Hexadecimal number systems
- Command Line fundamentals
- Computer Memory Layout

We have 2 main sections

- Programming (using the C++ language)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (using the C++ language)

Section 1
- Programming Fundamentals (C++ Basics)
- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming (Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation)

Section 2
- Introductory Data Structures and Big O notation
- Essential Data structures and Algorithm concepts
- Algorithm Analysis and Algorithmic Design Strategies

### Intro Computer Science
